# 12Month12Projects
This repository contains 12 projects in 12 months.

The aim of this task is to create 12 distinct projects in 12 months. Each project should be scoped to be able to be delivered and completed by the end of the month. It might be that different months build on a previous month project, but the project must be completed by the last day of the month. This is to enforce scoping and avoid scope creep.

Each project will be detailed in their own folder and on their own wiki Page

Month 1 - Usb To Serial PCB - [Wiki](https://github.com/richClubb/12Month12Projects/wiki/Month-01-Usb-To-Serial-PCB) - [Folder](https://github.com/richClubb/12Month12Projects/tree/master/Month01_UsbToSerial)

Month 2 - Self Balancing Robot - [Wiki](https://github.com/richClubb/12Month12Projects/wiki/Month-02-Self-Balancing-Robot) - [Folder](https://github.com/richClubb/12Month12Projects/tree/master/Month02_SelfBalancingRobot)

## Rules
1. Each project WILL take 1 month - If the project is not finished in the month then it can be revisited later, but it should be a secondary priority. The whole objective is to deliver and finish the project in 1 month, and if this is not possible then the project has not necessarily failed, but it needs to be tied off
2. Do not start work on another project until the start date - If you are working on a project do not start on another. It's fine to have ideas for new projects, but it should not go past the concept phase.
