# Month 3 - SolarPowerCharger

## Brief

I've been trying to create a wireless sensor node for various things but one of the big problems is power and not having to plug the devices in or change the batteries

## Research

Part of the problem here is having the output from the battery, I'm not sure exactly what the architecture would be here. I'm guessing that the IC handling the solar power and battery charging would have a second downstream device to handle the power conversion

## Objectives

### Primary

* Create a circuit which can take a solar panel and charge a AA LiIon or LiPo battery

### Secondary

There aren't really any secondary goals for this project

## Implementation

### Features

* Uninterruptable power from the battery, solar power or USB
* 3.3 V and 5 V power outputs
* Small form factor, wants to fit on the back of a AA battery holder
