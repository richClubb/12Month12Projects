# Month 2 - SelfBalancingRobot

## Brief

The project is to create a self-balancing robot with 2 wheels.

## Objectives

### Primary

1. Balancing and disturbance control - Peturbations from the upright position
1. Forward / backward motion - longitudinal movement
1. Self-righting - Getting upright from a flat position. This might be quite hard.

### Secondary

1. Left / right turning (tank track turning)
1. Wireless control (bluetooth?)
1. Simulink / Matlab model of the system to compare against the actual arrangement.
