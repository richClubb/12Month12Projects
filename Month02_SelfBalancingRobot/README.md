# Month 2 - SelfBalancingRobot

## Brief

The project is to create a self-balancing robot with 2 wheels.


## Research

In an initial stab I have two ADXL345 <https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL345.pdf> which can be used for the control system, however this might work for the balancing forward and backward motion but it might not be able to do the left/right turn control. An IMU might be a better idea <https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/5/5/0/MPU9250REV1.0.pdf> as it can do accelerometer and also be able to do the left/right turning with the gyroscope.

## Objectives

### Primary

1. Balancing and disturbance control
1. Forward / backward motion
1. Self-righting


### Secondary

1. Left / right turning (tank track turning)
1. Wireless control (bluetooth?)
